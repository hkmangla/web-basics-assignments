        <h1>Canvas</h1>
        <p>Canvas is an extremely durable plain-woven fabric used for making
           sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, and other items for which
           sturdiness is required. It is also popularly used by artists
           as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden
           frame. It is also used in such fashion objects as handbags,
           electronic device cases, and shoes.</p>
        <p>Modern canvas is usually made of cotton or linen, along
           with polyvinyl chloride, although historically it was made
           from hemp. It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such
           as denim, in being plain weave rather than twill weave.
           Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck. The
           threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven. The term
           duck comes from the Dutch word for cloth, doek. In the
           United States, canvas is classified in two ways: by
           weight (ounces per square yard) and by a graded number
           system. The numbers run in reverse of the weight so a number
           10 canvas is lighter than number 4.</p>
